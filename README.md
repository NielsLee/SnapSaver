## Notes
**On many Android devices, after capturing and storing a photo in a specified directory, it may not be immediately visible in the gallery. It could take some time or even a reboot before the photo appears in the gallery app. The author developed this software out of personal interest and cannot dedicate too much effort to solving this issue at the moment. If anyone reading this has a good solution, feel free to discuss it with the author via an Issue. Thank you very much!ðŸ˜Š**
